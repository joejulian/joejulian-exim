  #############################################################################
  # The following section of the ACL is concerned with local parts that contain
  # @ or % or ! or / or | or dots in unusual places.
  #
  # The characters other than dots are rarely found in genuine local parts, but
  # are often tried by people looking to circumvent relaying restrictions.
  # Therefore, although they are valid in local parts, these rules lock them
  # out, as a precaution.
  #
  # Empty components (two dots in a row) are not valid in RFC 2822, but Exim
  # allows them because they have been encountered. (Consider local parts
  # constructed as "firstinitial.secondinitial.familyname" when applied to
  # someone like me, who has no second initial.) However, a local part starting
  # with a dot or containing /../ can cause trouble if it is used as part of a
  # file name (e.g. for a mailing list). This is also true for local parts that
  # contain slashes. A pipe symbol can also be troublesome if the local part is
  # incorporated unthinkingly into a shell command line.
  #
  # Two different rules are used. The first one is stricter, and is applied to
  # messages that are addressed to one of the local domains handled by this
  # host. The line "domains = +local_domains" restricts it to domains that are
  # defined by the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The rule  blocks
  # local parts that begin with a dot or contain @ % ! / or |. If you have
  # local accounts that include these characters, you will have to modify this
  # rule.

          domains       = +local_domains
          local_parts   = ^[.] : ^.*[@%!/|]

  # The second rule applies to all other domains, and is less strict. The line
  # "domains = !+local_domains" restricts it to domains that are NOT defined by
  # the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The exclamation mark is a
  # negating operator. This rule allows your own users to send outgoing
  # messages to sites that use slashes and vertical bars in their local parts.
  # It blocks local parts that begin with a dot, slash, or vertical bar, but
  # allows these characters within the local part. However, the sequence /../
  # is barred. The use of @ % and ! is blocked, as before. The motivation here
  # is to prevent your users (or your users' viruses) from mounting certain
  # kinds of attack on remote sites.

  # lack of a Date: header line. If you are actually relaying out out from
  # MTAs, you may want to disable this. If you are handling both relaying from
  # MTAs and submissions from MUAs you should probably split them into two
  # lists, and handle them differently.

  # Recipient verification is omitted here, because in many cases the clients
  # are dumb MUAs that don't cope well with SMTP error responses. If you are
  # actually relaying out from MTAs, you should probably add recipient
  # verification here.

# The remaining routers handle addresses in the local domain(s), that is those
# domains that are defined by "domainlist local_domains" above.


# This router handles aliasing using a linearly searched alias file with the
# name SYSTEM_ALIASES_FILE. When this configuration is installed automatically,
# the name gets inserted into this file from whatever is set in Exim's
# build-time configuration. The default path is the traditional /etc/aliases.
# If you install this configuration by hand, you need to specify the correct
# path in the "data" setting below.
#
##### NB  You must ensure that the alias file exists. It used to be the case
##### NB  that every Unix had that file, because it was the Sendmail default.
##### NB  These days, there are systems that don't have it. Your aliases
##### NB  file should at least contain an alias for "postmaster".
#
# If any of your aliases expand to pipes or files, you will need to set
# up a user and a group for these deliveries to run under. You can do
# this by uncommenting the "user" option below (changing the user name
# as appropriate) and adding a "group" option if necessary. Alternatively, you
# can specify "user" on the transports that are used. Note that the transports

# This router handles forwarding using traditional .forward files in users'
# home directories. If you want it also to allow mail filtering when a forward
# file starts with the string "# Exim filter" or "# Sieve filter", uncomment
# the "allow_filter" option.

# If you want this router to treat local parts with suffixes introduced by "-"
# or "+" characters as if the suffixes did not exist, uncomment the two local_
# part_suffix options. Then, for example, xxxx-foo@your.domain will be treated
# in the same way as xxxx@your.domain by this router. You probably want to make
# the same change to the localuser router.

# The no_verify setting means that this router is skipped when Exim is
# verifying addresses. Similarly, no_expn means that this router is skipped if
# Exim is processing an EXPN command.

# The check_ancestor option means that if the forward file generates an

# passed on instead. This covers the case where A is aliased to B and B

# server_condition settings to specify how passwords are verified.
# They are set up to offer authentication to the client only if the
# connection is encrypted with TLS, so you also need to add support
# for TLS. See the global configuration options section at the start
# of this file for more about TLS.
#
# The default RCPT ACL checks for successful authentication, and will accept
# messages from authenticated users from anywhere on the Internet.

# 

# PLAIN authentication has no server prompts. The client sends its
# credentials in one lump, containing an authorization ID (which we do not
# use), an authentication ID, and a password. The latter two appear as
# $auth2 and $auth3 in the configuration and should be checked against a
# valid username and password. In a real configuration you would typically
# use $auth2 as a lookup key, and compare $auth3 against the result of the
# lookup, perhaps using the crypteq{}{} condition.

#PLAIN:
#  driver                     = plaintext
#  server_set_id              = $auth2
#  server_prompts             = :
#  server_condition           = ${if saslauthd{{$2}{$3}{smtp}} {1}}
#  server_advertise_condition = ${if def:tls_cipher }

# LOGIN authentication has traditional prompts and responses. There is no
# authorization ID in this mechanism, so unlike PLAIN the username and
# password are $auth1 and $auth2. Apart from that you can use the same
# server_condition setting for both authenticators.

#LOGIN:
#  driver                     = plaintext
#  server_set_id              = $auth1
#  server_prompts             = <| Username: | Password:
#  server_condition           = ${if saslauthd{{$1}{$2}{smtp}} {1}}
#  server_advertise_condition = ${if def:tls_cipher }
